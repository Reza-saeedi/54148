Prove that you are a hacker (i.e. problem solver)

Being a hacker means you do not leave a problem unsolved because it is written in Haskell.
Before joining S4Lab, you need to prove that you are a hacker, to do so, please answer the following questions:

* Many websites expose their “.git” files, please show how it could be dangerous.
* Imagine that we have 2**48 text files. Explain how can we find which files are the same.
* Write a hello-world C program and explain how we can dump its binary code with radare2.

Please remember that you do not need to write very much, and try to solve each task as automatically as you can.
